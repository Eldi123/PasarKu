# PasarKu

## Concept
"PasarKu" (Indonesian for "My Market") is a decentralized app (dApp) that connects small-scale vendors—like street food sellers, farmers, or artisans in Indonesia—to buyers using blockchain. It aims to solve common issues in Indonesia’s informal economy: lack of trust, high transaction fees, and limited access to digital payments. By using IDRX, vendors and buyers can transact securely with a stablecoin pegged to the Rupiah, avoiding crypto volatility.
## Why This Fits
- Local Relevance: Indonesia has a massive informal market (e.g., warungs, pasar tradisional). Blockchain can bring transparency and efficiency to these cash-heavy systems.

- IDRX Integration: Payments are made in IDRX, ensuring stability and aligning with the hackathon’s rules.

- Scalability: Lisk’s Layer 2 solution on Ethereum keeps fees low, making it viable for small transactions.

- Growth Potential: A successful prototype could expand blockchain use in Indonesia’s everyday economy.

## How It Works
### Vendor Onboarding:
- Vendors create a profile using Xellar’s social login kit (e.g., via Google or WhatsApp), generating a wallet instantly.

- They list products (e.g., "Sate Ayam – 25,000 IDR") with descriptions and photos.

### Buyer Experience:
- Buyers browse listings on the dApp (web or mobile interface).

- They pay with IDRX via their Xellar wallet, triggering a smart contract.

### Smart Contract:
- A simple smart contract holds the IDRX payment in escrow.

- Once the buyer confirms delivery (or a timeout occurs), funds release to the vendor.

Verified on Blockscout Explorer, as required.

### Trust Features:
- Vendor ratings stored on-chain for transparency.

- Option for dispute resolution via a community voting mechanism (future enhancement).

### Delivery:
- For physical goods, vendors coordinate pickup/delivery offline (e.g., via Gojek or local couriers).

- Digital goods (e.g., vouchers) could be delivered instantly via the dApp.

## Why Would People Use PasarKu? Key Advantages
To make PasarKu appealing, it needs to solve specific problems better than traditional marketplaces while being accessible. Here’s what could set it apart:
### Lower Fees Through Blockchain
- Problem: Platforms like Tokopedia or Shopee charge vendors significant fees (e.g., 2-10% per transaction), which cuts into profits for small vendors like farmers or warung owners.

- PasarKu’s Advantage: Lisk’s Layer 2 blockchain offers low transaction fees (often cents per transaction). PasarKu could pass these savings to vendors, letting them keep more money compared to centralized platforms.

- User Appeal: Vendors earn more per sale, and buyers might see lower prices if vendors pass on savings.

### Trust and Transparency
- Problem: In informal markets, trust is a big issue—buyers worry about fake goods, and vendors fear non-payment. Traditional platforms rely on centralized ratings, which can be manipulated.

- PasarKu’s Advantage: Blockchain ensures transparent, tamper-proof records. Payments are held in escrow via smart contracts, only released when the buyer confirms delivery. Vendor ratings could be stored on-chain, making them verifiable and harder to fake.

- User Appeal: Buyers feel safer knowing funds are secure until delivery, and vendors are guaranteed payment upon completion.

### Stable and Accessible Payments with IDRX
- Problem: Many small vendors don’t accept digital payments due to complexity or fees, and buyers in rural areas may not trust volatile cryptocurrencies.

- PasarKu’s Advantage: IDRX is a stablecoin pegged to the Rupiah, so it feels like using regular money but with blockchain’s security and low fees. Xellar’s social login makes wallet creation as easy as signing in with WhatsApp or Google—no crypto knowledge needed.

- User Appeal: Vendors and buyers use a familiar currency (IDR equivalent) without needing bank accounts or crypto exchanges.

### Empowering Small Vendors
- Problem: Farmers and artisans often struggle to reach broader markets due to lack of tech skills or high platform costs.

- PasarKu’s Advantage: PasarKu could focus on hyper-local markets (e.g., village-to-village sales) and simplify listing (e.g., a form as easy as posting on Instagram). It could also integrate with local delivery apps like Gojek for seamless logistics.

- User Appeal: Vendors gain access to buyers beyond their physical location, increasing sales without needing advanced skills.

### Community-Driven and Inclusive
- Problem: Centralized platforms prioritize big sellers, leaving small vendors struggling to compete.

- PasarKu’s Advantage: As a decentralized platform, PasarKu could emphasize community ownership—e.g., vendors vote on platform updates via tokens (a stretch goal). It could also offer multilingual support (Bahasa Indonesia, Javanese) and offline workshops to onboard users.

- User Appeal: Vendors feel valued and part of a fair ecosystem tailored to their needs.
